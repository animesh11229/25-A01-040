   <p>Semantic tags in HTML are special elements that describe the meaning and purpose of the content they contain. Unlike non-semantic tags such as div and span, semantic tags make the structure of a webpage clearer to both browsers and developers. Examples include header for the top section, nav for navigation menus, article for independent content, section for grouped content, aside for side information, and footer for the bottom section of a page. Using semantic tags improves readability, accessibility, and search engine optimization (SEO), as they help search engines and assistive technologies understand the layout and importance of different parts of a webpage.</p>
